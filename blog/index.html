What are the benefits of version control?

The benefits of version control are that it allows developers to keep track of the process they used to create a program.  With all the different things happening on a big project, version control allows the team to see who did what where when.  Without version control, it would be painstakingly difficult to check on what changes were made and how they affect the project.

How does git help you keep track of changes?

Git allows you to keep track of changes by constantly logging every action taken when operating in a branch of a repo.  If you add, delete, move, rename or generally change an aspect of a file or program, git automatically tracks it.  Then when sufficient changes have been made to submit these changes, git allows you to lump them all together in a commit.

Why use GitHub to store your code?

Using GitHub to store your code is a way of cataloging all of your changes.  It is a vast storage space for git repositories and has built in tools to make the process as smooth as possible.  With GitHub you can clone, fork, push, pull and generally collaborate on your repos.  It also allows you to make pull requests so you can submit changes to others and keep a running log of all those changes.

What are the benefits of version control?

The benefits of version control are that it allows developers to keep track of <br>the process they used to create a program.  With all the different things <br>happening on a big project, version control allows the team to see who did <br>what where when.  Without version control, it would be painstakingly difficult<br> to check on what changes were made and how they affect the project.<br>



How does git help you keep track of changes?<br>

Git allows you to keep track of changes by constantly logging every action<br> taken when operating in a branch of a repo.  If you add, delete, move, rename <br>or generally change an aspect of a file or program, git automatically tracks <br>it.  Then when sufficient changes have been made to submit these changes, <br>git allows you to lump them all together in a commit.<br>

Why use GitHub to store your code?<br>

Using GitHub to store your code is a way of cataloging all of your changes.  It<br> is a vast storage space for git repositories and has built in tools to make<br> the process as smooth as possible.  With GitHub you can clone, fork, push, <br>pull and generally collaborate on your repos.  It also allows you to make <br>pull requests so you can submit changes to others and keep a running log of <br>all those changes.<br>

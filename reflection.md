**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I definitely solidified the difference between padding and margin on this one.
Padding is the space from the content inside the border and margin is the space
on the outside, separating the element from other elements.  I also learned
some cool stuff about border-radius like if you make it 100% it creates a
circle.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

This was the big one for me.  I am still learning how to properly use their
nuances, but I'm starting to see when I want to use absolute vs. fixed vs.
relative.  More than anything though I got an insight in to inheritance.  I
figured out how to make the parent fixed and the child relative in order to
position divs next to each other.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Easiest was the sizing aspects.  Getting everything the right size was no big
deal.  The most difficult thing was definitely positioning.  Figuring out how
and why it was behaving in ways I didn't expect was extremely frustrating at
times.  It took me a bit longer than I expected, but figuring it out the hard
way is absolutely going to pay off in the future.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I added a profile picture as well as a background picture and I think the
background picture was the most educational part of the exercise.  It forced
me to try out a bunch of different things in order to make it turn out the way
I wanted it to.  I learned about using top, bottom, max-width, max-height,
z-index and a whole bunch of other things that go along with them.

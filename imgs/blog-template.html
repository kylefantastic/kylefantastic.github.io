How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was interesting to get my pair's perspective on layout becuase I thouhgt my layout was a little boring.  Pairing on this was really useful from a collaborative design standpoint.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

It was definitely helpful because if there is something that doesn't look right I may not always notice it, but with two sets of eyes loking at it you can get a broader view that reflects more perspectives.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

It had to be a natural flow of ideas and visually engaging.  It had to be organized without being bland and interesting without being distracting or confusing.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

I learned a few new ways to use tags that I hadn't used before.

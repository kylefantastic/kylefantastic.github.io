        Welcome weary web wanderer to the official blog of Kyle Smith,<br>
      web developer extraordinaire.  If this is your first time visiting,<br>
      perhaps you would like to check out the About Me section to better<br>
      understand what I'm all about.  Otherwise let's get to the blog.<br>
      <br>
<br>
<br>
        To the right you will find the navigation to my comprehensive<br>
      blog posts, accrued during my tenure as a Dev BootCamp student.<br>
      It has been an arduous and edifying journey of ups, downs, and<br>
      hard-fought victories.  You can literally witness the progress<br>
      of the last five months before your eyes (at a much faster pace).

So you want to create an object that takes a bunch of information and can manipulate that information in ways that you can determine on your own?  Well I think you should be using a class.  A class is a Ruby object that acts as a container for all the information you want it to hold.  This can be categorical data, methods or variables that go into the class to compose its structure.  To define a class you start with the def keyword (like a method) followed by the name of the class, the convention is to do this with the first letter capitalized.  It will also have to have the keyword end at the end so Ruby knows where the class stops.  After the method is defined there is typically a method to initialize the class, which is a special method called initialize.  Within this method you can put any arguments, define any variables, or do any other work that you want the class to have that will be unique to the class.<br><br>

If you want a variable to be accessible within the rest of the class, not just in the method you create it, you will need to make it an instance variable.  All that this means is that when creating the variable, you put an @ sign before the variable name.  Then it will be accessible anywhere in the class.  You can also create methods within the class that can be called by appending them to the name of your new class instance with the dot syntax.  (see below)  These are known as instance methods because they are called when you call the instance of a class.  This is typically done by creating a new instance of a class with the name of the class followed by a dot with the instance method new.  It all goes together to look something like this.</p>

  In this example the class is called Language, and initialized with variables for name and a creator.  Whatever the name and creator are when the class is later initialized, will be accessible throughout the method by assigning the local variables to class variables with the @ sign.  Another method called description is added to the class to print out a message about the language name and creator.  Then there are three instances of the class initialized with the new method, ruby, python, and javascript.  Finally the instance method of description is called for each instance of the Language class, which will print out the correpsonding description of each language.

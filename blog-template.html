Hello again folks.  Today’s topic will be an introduction to Ruby on Rails because before today I knew nothing about it and it was really bothering me.  So Ruby on Rails (aka Rails) is a framework for web applications.  This means that it can be used to develop dynamic websites, web applications, web services, and web resources.  It is what is called a model-view-controller framework meaning that the model updates the view for the user and the user uses a form of control to manipulate the model, and upon manipulating the model, the process continues.  This is known as the request/response cycle.</p><br>

Rails provides default structures for a database, a web services and web pages.  In order to create a new app with Rails you type “rails new” into your program which will generate files and folders t ouse to build the app.  The rails new command is the starting point for every Rails project.  Next to install software packages (known as gems) you type bundle install.  From there you will have many resources at your disposal to create dynamic apps, sites and other interesting things in a streamlined and user-friendly process.  Rails is designed with the intention of “Convention over Configuration” meaning there are useful shortcuts and built-in design that allows the developer to not have to repeat themselves while programming.</p><br>
<p>
Rails is useful for a host of web based utilities and many interactive sites use it to run.  A short list of these include  Airbnb, GitHub, Yammer, Scribd, Shopify, Hulu, and Basecamp.  As of May 2014, it is estimated that more than 600,000 web sites are running Ruby on Rails.  Learning it will be a huge complement to a developer’s toolkit and I intend to get myself caught up to speed as soon as possible.
